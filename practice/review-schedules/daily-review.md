# Daily Algorithm Review Routine

A consistent daily practice routine is the foundation of mastering algorithms. This guide provides a structured 15-30 minute daily session designed to build muscle memory and reinforce patterns.

## The Daily Formula

**Total Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Best Time:** Morning (fresh mind) or evening (end-of-day reflection)
**Minimum Commitment:** 5 days/week for sustainable progress

### Session Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Yesterday's Review (5 min)                       │
│ 2. Warm-up Problem (5-8 min)                        │
│ 3. Pattern Focus Problem (10-15 min)                │
│ 4. Tomorrow's Prep (2 min)                          │

## Part 1: Yesterday's Review (5 minutes)

### Goal
Solidify what you learned yesterday before moving forward.

### Daily Checklist
- [ ] Open yesterday's problem in your editor
- [ ] Write the solution from memory (no peeking)
- [ ] Compare with your original solution
- [ ] Identify what you forgot or struggled with
- [ ] Note one key insight to remember

### Quick Questions
1. What was the time complexity?
2. What pattern did this use?
3. What was the key insight?

**If you struggle:** That's the point! Struggling means you need more reviews. Add this problem to your spaced repetition queue.

---

## Part 2: Warm-up Problem (5-8 minutes)

### Goal
Build confidence and get your brain in coding mode.

### Problem Selection Strategy

**Week 1-2: Foundation Building**
- Focus on array and string basics
- Example problems: E001, E008, E038, E052, E067

**Week 3-4: Data Structure Fundamentals**
- Focus on linked lists, stacks, queues, trees
- Example problems: E041, E043, E044, E045, E057, E082, E086

**Week 5-6: Hash Tables & Sets**
- Focus on lookups and frequency counting
- Example problems: E055, E069, E078, E081, E083, E095

**Week 7-8: Tree Traversals**
- Focus on different traversal patterns
- Example problems: E041, E058, E059, E091, E099

| Sunday | Rest or catch-up | Optional: solve a favorite problem for fun |

### Warm-up Execution
1. Set 8-minute timer
2. Code the solution without hints
3. If stuck at 4 minutes, read first hint only
4. If stuck at 6 minutes, read solution approach
5. Complete and test the solution

**Success Criteria:** Solved correctly within time, can explain approach in one sentence.

### Daily Pattern Practice Flow

**Monday-Wednesday: Learn**
- Read pattern guide (5 min)
- Solve easy example (10 min)
- Identify pattern signature

**Thursday-Friday: Apply**
- Solve medium problem (15 min)
- Compare your solution to optimal
- Note what makes this pattern effective

### Pattern Focus Execution
1. Set 15-minute timer
2. Attempt without looking at strategy guide
3. After 8 minutes, if stuck: review pattern signature from guide
4. Complete solution even if it takes longer (mark time)
5. Analyze: "What pattern clue did I miss?"

**Success Criteria:** Identified the pattern within 3 minutes, implemented correctly (even if slow).

### End-of-Session Checklist
- [ ] Log today's problems in progress tracker
- [ ] Mark difficulty rating (1-5) for each problem
- [ ] Queue tomorrow's warm-up problem
- [ ] Review tomorrow's pattern focus area
- [ ] Note any concepts to review before tomorrow

## Difficulty Rating System

Rate each problem immediately after solving to track your growth:

| Rating | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Trivial, solved in < 5 min | Archive, don't review again |
| 2 | Easy, minor mistakes | Review once in 7 days |
| 3 | Moderate, needed hints | Review in 3 days, then 7 days |
| 4 | Challenging, struggled significantly | Review tomorrow, 3 days, 7 days |
| 5 | Very hard, couldn't solve | Re-attempt in 2 days with fresh eyes |

---

## Adaptation Strategies

### If You Have Less Time (10 minutes)
- Skip warm-up OR pattern focus (alternate days)
- Always do yesterday's review (non-negotiable)
- Solve one quality problem > rushing through multiple

### If You Have More Time (45-60 minutes)
- Add a second pattern focus problem
- Implement problem variations
- Review and annotate your code with complexity analysis
- Solve a related follow-up problem

### If You Miss a Day
- Don't try to "catch up" by doing 2x work
- Review the most recent problem you solved
- Continue with today's schedule
- Consistency > perfection

### If You're Consistently Struggling
**Signs you need to adjust:**
- Warm-ups regularly take > 12 minutes
- Can't solve pattern problems in 20 minutes
- Forgetting yesterday's solutions frequently

**Adjustments:**
1. Spend a week reviewing fundamentals (time/space complexity)
2. Drop pattern problems, do 2-3 easy problems instead
3. Review strategy guides before attempting problems
4. Pair with a study partner for accountability

---

## Motivation & Mindset

### Daily Mantras
- "Struggling is learning in disguise"
- "I solve one problem better today than yesterday"
- "Consistency beats intensity"

### Celebrate Small Wins
- Solved without hints? Celebrate.
- Identified the pattern immediately? Note it.
- Coded cleanly on first try? That's growth.

### When You Feel Stuck
Remember: **Everyone struggles**. The difference between those who succeed and those who don't is showing up every day.

If you can't solve a problem:
1. That's data, not failure
2. You're identifying gaps in knowledge
3. Tomorrow you'll be better equipped

---

## Integration with Spaced Repetition

As you complete problems, tag them for review using the spaced repetition system:

- Rating 3-5? Add to [Spaced Repetition Queue](./spaced-repetition-guide.md)
- Review intervals: Day 1 → 3 → 7 → 14 → 30
- Track in your weekly review session

---

## Quick Reference

### Problem Selection by Current Level

**Beginner (Month 1-2)**
- 2 easy problems/day
- Focus on understanding code, not speed
- Use hints liberally

**Intermediate (Month 3-6)**
- 1 easy warm-up + 1 medium problem
- Try to solve without hints for 10 minutes
- Focus on pattern recognition

**Advanced (Month 7+)**
- 1 medium + occasional hard problem
- Time yourself like an interview
- Focus on optimization and edge cases

### Emergency Shortcuts

**Only have 5 minutes?**
→ Review yesterday's problem solution only

**Only have 10 minutes?**
→ Solve one easy problem as practice

**Completely burned out?**
→ Watch a 10-minute algorithm explanation video instead
→ Read a strategy guide
→ Rest is productive too

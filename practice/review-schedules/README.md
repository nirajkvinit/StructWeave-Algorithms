## Recommended Schedule

### Beginner (Months 1-3)

**Daily (30 min):**
- 20 min: [Daily Review](./daily-review.md) - Focus on easy problems

**Weekly (2 hours):**
- Skip Phase 3 (Stretch Problem) initially
- Focus on Pattern Consolidation and Mock Interview with easy-medium problems

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Start adding problems after Week 2
- Keep queue small (15-20 problems max)

---

### Intermediate (Months 4-8)

**Daily (30 min):**
- 5 min: Yesterday's review
- 8 min: Warm-up (easy)
- 15 min: Pattern focus (medium)
- 2 min: Logging

**Daily SR (15 min):**
- Review 2-3 problems from spaced repetition queue

**Weekly (2.5 hours):**
- Full weekly review protocol
- Include stretch problem (medium-hard)

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Active queue: 40-60 problems
- Archive liberally

---

### Advanced (Months 9+)

**Daily (30 min):**
- 5 min: SR reviews (Box 4-6)
- 20 min: New medium-hard problem
- 5 min: Logging and planning

**Weekly (3 hours):**
- Full weekly review
- Multiple hard problems
- Back-to-back mock interviews

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Active queue: 60-120 problems
- Focus on hard problems and variations

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Consistency Over Intensity
- 30 minutes every day beats 4 hours once a week
- Missing one day? Just continue tomorrow. Don't try to "catch up."

### 2. Active Recall Over Re-reading
- Always attempt to solve before looking at hints
- Struggle is where learning happens
- Use spaced repetition to force retrieval practice

### 3. Pattern Recognition Over Memorization
- Focus on understanding why a pattern works
- Don't memorize solutions
- Build intuition through repeated exposure (spaced repetition)

### 4. Progressive Difficulty
- Start with easy problems to build confidence
- Gradually increase difficulty as patterns become familiar
- Challenge yourself weekly with stretch problems

### 5. Reflect and Adjust
- Weekly retrospectives identify what's working
- Adjust schedule based on your progress
- Track struggles to identify gaps

## Common Questions

### How do I start?

**Week 1:**
1. Read [Daily Review Guide](./daily-review.md)
2. Solve your first problem: [E001 - Two Sum](../../problems/easy/E001_two_sum.md)
3. Follow the daily routine for 5 days
4. On Saturday, do your first [Weekly Review](./weekly-review.md)

**Week 2:**
1. Continue daily practice
2. Set up [Spaced Repetition System](./spaced-repetition-guide.md)
3. Add Week 1 problems to SR queue

---

### How much time should I dedicate?

**Minimum effective dose:**
- Daily: 15 minutes (one problem)
- Weekly: 1 hour (retrospective + pattern review)
- Spaced repetition: Built into daily practice

**Recommended:**
- Daily: 30 minutes
- Weekly: 2-3 hours
- Total: 4-5 hours/week

**Intensive (interview prep):**
- Daily: 60-90 minutes
- Weekly: 4 hours
- Total: 10-12 hours/week

---

### What if I miss a day?

**Don't panic. Don't try to catch up.**

1. Review the most recent problem you solved
2. Continue with today's schedule
3. Spaced repetition will naturally surface problems you missed
4. Focus on consistency, not perfection

---

### Which tracking system should I use?

**Start simple:**
- Week 1-2: Paper notebook
- Week 3-4: Simple text file or spreadsheet
- Month 2+: Notion or Anki if you need more features

**The best system is the one you'll actually use.**

---

### How do I know if I'm making progress?

**Weekly metrics to track:**
- Number of problems solved without hints
- Average time per problem (should decrease)
- Patterns you can recognize immediately
- Confidence level (1-10 self-rating)

**Monthly metrics:**
- Problems in Box 4+ (spaced repetition)
- Hard problems attempted
- Mock interview performance

**Qualitative signs of progress:**
- "Oh, this is a two-pointer problem!" (immediate recognition)
- Solving easier problems in < 10 minutes
- Explaining solutions clearly
- Spotting edge cases without prompting

---

## Success Stories Pattern

**Month 1:** "I'm overwhelmed. So many problems..."
- Normal! You're building the foundation.
- Focus on easy problems and consistency.

**Month 2:** "I'm starting to see patterns..."
- You're connecting the dots.
- Pattern recognition is developing.

**Month 3:** "This problem is similar to one I solved before..."
- Transfer learning is happening.
- You're building intuition.

**Month 6:** "I can solve most medium problems..."
- You've hit a major milestone.
- Ready for most technical interviews.

**Month 12:** "I can explain algorithms to others..."
- True mastery.
- You've internalized the patterns.

## Tips for Mathematical Problems

1. **Think before coding**: Most problems have elegant solutions
2. **Estimate bounds**: Know when brute force will timeout
3. **Look for patterns**: Test with small values first
4. **Use math libraries**: Don't reinvent the wheel (but understand how they work)
5. **Study proofs**: Understanding *why* helps you generalize
